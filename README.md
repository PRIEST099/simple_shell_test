THE GATES OF SHELL

This repository contains the files to simulate a basic **Unix Shell** with its respective commands. It uses the POSIX API to implement many of the same functionalities of the first Ken Thompson's Shell and It is made to carry out the  **0x16. C - Simple Shell** project at [ALX Africa.](https://www.alxafrica.com/ "ALX Africa.")

The predominantly used calls are **read**, **write**, **open**, **execve**, **exit**, **fflush**, **fork**, **free**, **malloc**, **getline**, **isatty**, **perror**, **strtok**, **wait**, and **waitpid**.

This simple shell is a Shell interface written in C programming language that gives to the user a prompt *Hell_Shell>> *, after it accepts, it executes a user inputted command in a separate process called child process.

## General.

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall` `-Werror` `-Wextra` and `-pedantic`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl "betty-style.pl") and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl "betty-doc.pl")
- Your shell should not have any memory leaks
- No more than 5 functions per file
- All your header files should be include guarded

## Requirements:

* Operating System: [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/)

* Compiler: [GCC 4.8.4](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/)

## Features:
* This program displays a prompt and waits that the user types a command. A command line always ends with a new line (when user push *ENTER* key).
* The prompt is displayed again each time a command has been executed.
* When the user enters exit, *Hell shell* will end and returns the status 0.
* When the user enters exit *[status]*, *Hell Shell* will end and returns the inputted status, where *status* is a value from 0 to 255. 
* The user could stop the program using *Ctrl+D* (end of file).
* The shell handles the command lines with arguments and pathways.
* The program does not quit when the user imputs ^C (Ctrl+C).
* The program prints the current enviroment when the user types *env*.
* This program executes the most common shell commands as *ls*, *grep*, *find*, *pwd*, *rm*, *cp*, *mv*, *exit*, *env*, *history*, etc... with arguments.
* If an executable cannot be found, It prints an error message and displays the prompt again.
* This Shell supports commentaries using *#*, 
* The *Hell Shell* does NOT support wildcard characters such as ls \*.dat in parameters (or commands).
* This shell does NOT support pipes *|*, shell logical operators as *&& or ||*, neither commands separator *;*.

## Process Description

The next steps are a brief description about how the shell works:

1. First, the parent process is created when the user run the program.
2. Then, the *isatty()* function using *STDIN_FILENO* file descriptor -fd- to tests if there is an open file descriptor referring to a terminal. If *isatty()* returns 1, the prompt is showed using *write()* with *STDOUT_FILENO* as fd and waits for an input user command line.
3. When the user types a command, *getline()* function reads an entire line from the stream and *strtok()* function breaks the inputted command into a sequence of non-empty tokens.
4. Next, it creates a separate child process suing *fork()* that performs the inputted command. Unless otherwise is specified, the parent process waits for the child to exit before continuing.
5. After tokening the command, *execve()* function brings and executes it, the it frees all allocated memory with *free()*.
6. Finally, the program returns to main process: prints the prompt, and waits for another user input.
